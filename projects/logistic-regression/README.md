# Property Sales Logistic Regression Project

## Overview

This project aims to implement a Logistic Regression model to predict property sales using the "Property Sales" dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:
[Property Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales)

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `datesold`: Date of the property sale.
- `price`: Sale price of the property.
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms in the property.

- `zipcode`: Property's ZIP code.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `src/`: Python source code for the Logistic Regression model(s).
- `results/`: Directory containing picture and description of the solution.
