The results presented above seem to show that this LLM construction in some circumstances and for some data is more accurate in predicting time series than other, simpler models are.
However it is still not universally a better option. What's more, the training of such a construction as we've described is more computationally intensive and time-consuming, than the training of a simple network.
Therefore, depending on the dataset and the particular prediction goal, other models may prove superior.

Therefore, more research is required into optimisation of different parameteers of the described LLM, and how its performance may further be improved.
